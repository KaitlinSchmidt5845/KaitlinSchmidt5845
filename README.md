## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a game developer creating immersive 2D and 3D games using Unity and C#. This project demonstrates how to build interactive, visually compelling games by focusing on clean game logic, realistic physics, and performance-conscious design.

At the core of this project is well-structured game logic, written in C#. Each mechanicâ€”from player movement and enemy AI to power-ups and scoringâ€”is modular and easy to maintain. The codebase follows solid architectural principles such as component-based design and event-driven patterns, making it simple to extend gameplay features or integrate new systems.

This project also takes advantage of Unityâ€™s powerful physics engines. Whether simulating real-world gravity in a 3D environment or creating precise collision detection in a 2D platformer, I use Rigidbody components, colliders, and physics materials to achieve responsive and realistic gameplay. Triggers and raycasting are also employed to handle in-game interactions and events efficiently.

Performance optimization is a key focus, especially when targeting multiple platforms. Techniques such as object pooling, baked lighting, occlusion culling, and efficient scene management are used to reduce memory and CPU overhead. Scripts are profiled regularly using Unity's built-in tools to ensure smooth frame rates and responsive controls.

This repository provides a complete foundation for developing Unity-based games, whether youâ€™re building for desktop, mobile, or web platforms. Itâ€™s ideal for developers looking to understand the core building blocks of engaging gameplay, physics-based interactions, and scalable project architecture.
